# IT-Academy-REACT-S6

A client whose main product is a business management website built with React, has asked us to develop a tutorial. Using two buttons, new users can move back and forth through the tips, changing the help text and the background image.

As we currently do not have the necessary material to create the tutorial, we will show the client the following 4 steps:
- We will create a website in React from scratch to go on to create our first components and make use of accessories.
- We will modify the page to make it an interactive website that shows a story.
- We'll use styled-components to apply styles to the web.
- We will add actions so that the user can interact with our application.
